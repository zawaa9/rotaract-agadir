Hi! I’m Nour I’m a medical professional originally from Marrakech, and I joined Rotaract because I’m passionate about making a positive impact in my community. I'm especially interested in anything related to education, mental health advocacy and youth empowerment. I love collaborating with others who are driven to make a real difference, and I’m always looking for new ways to contribute my skills to causes that matter. Outside of Rotaract, I’m into Music, sports, hiking  and I’m excited to grow, give back, and connect with like-minded people.
