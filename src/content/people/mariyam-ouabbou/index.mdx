Hello! I'm Mariyam, an architecture graduate who loves challenges, teamwork, and positive energy. I joined Rotaract because I wanted to be part of something bigger; a community that brings people together to create change. For me, Rotaract is not just volunteering, it's about leadership, friendship, and developing a mindset that inspires others.
