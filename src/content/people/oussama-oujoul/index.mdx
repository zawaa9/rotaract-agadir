I’m Oussama Oujoul and I joined Rotaract because I’m passionate about community service, leadership, and making a positive impact. I love connecting with people who share a vision of creating meaningful change, both locally and globally. Outside of Rotaract, I enjoy volunteering, and I’m always looking for new ways to grow, learn, and give back.
